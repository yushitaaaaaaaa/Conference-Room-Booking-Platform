# Conference Room Booking Platform

A fully developed and production-ready **Conference Room Booking Platform** built from scratch during my internship at **Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. (TCIL)**. Designed to streamline conference room scheduling, the system provides real-time availability, calendar-based booking, approval workflows, and administrative insights. It supports both user and admin roles, offering a modern, responsive interface with a consistent and professional UI.

This application was successfully deployed for internal use and actively manages daily conference room reservations at TCIL.

*Note: The source code for this project cannot be uploaded to GitHub as it was developed for internal use at TCIL. This repository is intended only to demonstrate the features and UI of the system. All functionalities shown were fully implemented and deployed.*
